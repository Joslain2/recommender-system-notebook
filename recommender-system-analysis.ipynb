    "Have you ever wondered how Facebook suggests friends to you based on the friends you have already? I would like you keep in mind that behind this scenes there is a complexe statistical algorithm that made these suggestions. Such system are called recommender system. \n",
    "\n",
    "Nowdays Recommender systems are among the most popular applications of data science. They are used for predicting the \"rating\" or \"preference\" that a user would give to an item. Almost every major tech company has applied them in some form or the other: YouTube uses it to decide which video to play next on autoplay, Facebook uses it to recommend pages to like and people to follow, Amazon uses it to suggest products to customers,...\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this project is to build a book recommender system. In order to make sure that such project may be feasible, standard datasets are required to develop, explore, and familiarize with how to develop recommender systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will discover the book-crossing dataset and how to prepare the data for modeling a basic recommender system. Algorithms for making recommendations require data to be prepared and structured in some ways. Leading by the idea of vector space model, we will find out means to analyse, explore and organise our data set in order the get  appropriate matrices according to each machine learning algorithm logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to reach the goal, different analysis will be performed on the data in order to obtain a reliable data distribution because the performances of the prediction algorithms depend on it.\n",

The most interesting thing is that, we can not find these informations about Users and books in the table rating directly but we can follow these links in their respective tables.

    "Now that we have done some visualisations about data, it is time to try using some interesting algorithms on recommender systems. The first one is based on similarities between books. The Pearson's correlation coeficient we are going to use, measures the lineair correlation between two variables. The basic principle of the method is that if we suppose that the rate attributed to books by users $U_i$ and $U_j$ are random incomplete  vectors $X_i\\in \\mathbf{R}^n$ and $X_j\\in \\mathbf{R}^m$ of an unknow distribution, therefore it is possible to define the linear correlation between $X_i$ and $X_j$ using Pearson's formula given by:\n",
    "$\\rho = \\frac{Cov(X_i,X_j)}{\\sqrt{Var(X_i)} \\times \\sqrt{Var(X_j)}}$. Where $Cov(X_i,X_j) = \\mathbf{E}[(X_i-\\mathbf{E}(X_i))\\times (X_j-\\mathbf{E}(X_j))]$. As indicated in the formula we must find out the average rating of each book in the dataset, count the occurence rating of each book and hence getting rid of users with less than 200 ratings and books with less than 100 rating for more accuracy as stupiled in the \"Building A Book Recommender System – The Basics, kNN and Matrix Factorization\" tutorial."
